This week-end I listened to a panel about [ethics in radio-story-telling from the third coast festival](http://www.thirdcoastfestival.org/library/1605-journalism-and-storytelling-frenemies). It&#8217;s really interesting stuff, I recommend to anyone interested in making audio. In it people talk about their golden rules for producing stories. And of course there is a real gem by Ira Glass in there, I needed to transcribe for further reference. Here it goes:

  * Make stuff you yourself would be willing to listen to.
  * Don&#8217;t say anything shitty about anyone on the radio without giving them a chance to respond.
  * Objectivity is impossible, but you can always achieve fairness.
  * Start the music underneath your story in the middle of the rising action. Whatever is said immediately after you lose the music sounds extra **important**. Like you actually talk, no the way you kid yourself you talk, you fake sounding s.o.b.
  * If you&#8217;re performing badly on the mic, it&#8217;s because you are not relaxed enough. To fix it, lower the pitch of your voice.
  * If a piece isn&#8217;t working, do another interview.
  * To write a good ending, go back to the beginning. Or tell the one anecdote, or kill the last piece of tape or paraphrase it in script.
  * Killing a mediocre story is victory. Killing a mediocre story is making room for an excellent story.
  * Most stories want to be dull and it&#8217;s only through an act of will they become anything but.
