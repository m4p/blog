With all the new podcasting things to happen and all the great new shows like [Reply All](http://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/) my favorite podcast still is a show from 2009. A show that has published only seven episodes since 2009: [A life well wasted](http://alifewellwasted.com).

Robert Ashley, its creator, describes it as &#8220;an internet radio show about video games and the people who love them&#8221;, which strikes me as admirably modest. I&#8217;d call it the &#8220;This American Life&#8221; of video games.

What makes ALWW stand out is production value and polish. It&#8217;s well edited, every tape, music, sound effect is intentionally placed. It&#8217;s crafted. Topical. Concentrated. It stands on its own. It&#8217;s something to be proud of. Check it out.

In 2014 my goal was to get started with video documentary production and [learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRzwY837w6s&list=PLYhEK9exwoaagDnDphIBumnigtAe3gPpL&index=5) a bit about that. I will continue to work on that, but in 2015 I want to learn how to create something like ALWW. I want to produce at least one episode of a radio show that&#8217;s half as good.

Don&#8217;t disappoint me, 2015!
