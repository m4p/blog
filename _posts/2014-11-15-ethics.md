If you follow my work a bit you know that my company TheCodingMonkeys published its first original game this year. It&#8217;s called [RULES!](http://rulesgame.net) and is a fun action-puzzler. Marcel, Aga and everyone else who worked on it poured their [hearts and souls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRzwY837w6s&list=PLYhEK9exwoaagDnDphIBumnigtAe3gPpL&index=5) into this little thing for over nine months. We love that thing and we are proud of it.

Last week however we got a mail that pointed us to a browser game that looked more or less exactly like our iOS game. We had been cloned.

![The Rules! compared to RULES!]({{ "/assets/teaser-vgl.jpg" | absolute_url }})

From the looks of it, the company responsible for publishing the game is based in Germany, like us. Here are a few of their games you might recognize by a different name:

![Other games by the company]({{ "/assets/othergames.jpg" | absolute_url }})

In the case of RULES! they did not stop at the graphics design, however. Everything, down to tutorial, game play, level design and even music and sound effects is a cheap copy of what we did in RULES!. To illustrate here&#8217;s a side by side comparison video. (I sped up the ads between levels for the clone, they last 30 seconds each.)



Adding insult to injury, this company is being **government-sponsored** by the [German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy](http://www.zim-bmwi.de) and supplies its browser games to two of the biggest german web mail providers.

So where does that leave us?<a href="#footnote-1-65" id="note-1-65" rel="footnote">1</a> Well, first of all I will talk to my lawyers, I guess. Secondly, I certainly will check back with the government why they are sponsoring a company like that.

And thirdly. Well thirdly I&#8217;m hurt. I am disappointed. We aren&#8217;t the first to be disgustingly cloned, but that does not make it feel better. The people that created RULES worked for months on every little detail to make sure its a great experience. Having these torn to bits, badly reimplemented and cobbled together to create something to earn a few quick ad bucks feels vile. And criminally unfair.

    Update: The company has taken down the clone after multiple requests to do so.<a href="#note-1-65" class="footnote-return">&#8617;</a>
